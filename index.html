<h1>welcome</h1>
<p>I am a first-year student and a programmer interested in machine learning.

This website is still under construction, so I will fill it with placeholder text; to be changed later.

My favourite languages are C and Typst. <a href="https://typst.app">Typst</a> is a language created for writing scientific papers and math homework. It is a great blend between the robustness of LaTeX and the simplicity of Markdown. On top of this it retains all of the functionality of an actual programming language, which is also well-designed. This makes it extremely pleasant to write up beautiful documents with the ability to preview them live.

I would like to learn Rust one day — it seems like the Typst of the low-level world. Although it's high up on my bucket list, instead of dedicating my time to learn a new language, I want to try writing a machine learning library in C from scratch. For the past few weeks I have been teaching myself the math required for this project.

Here are my <a href="https://github.com/forkasiewicz/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>. I have finally figured out a good way to sync my configs between Linux and macOS, I have an install script reading from a configuration file which tells it OS-specific directories, as well as being able to symlink specific config files based on the os.
